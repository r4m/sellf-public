Sellf
=====

Sellf is the mobile reimagination of customer relationship and sales management, allowing for fast tracking of business opportunities on the go.
Sellf eliminates the overhead of classic tools – like CRMs – often expensive, complex and desktop based.

I'm in charge of developing the Ruby on Rails backend of the app and its Android version.
